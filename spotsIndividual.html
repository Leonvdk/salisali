            <h2 class="wave-title">Kind Of Wave? <br> <p class="wave-text">Stretching away to the south of the Tejo River is a 30 km strip of coast that is the most consistent zone for Lisbon’s surfers.
                The northern section of this coast is built up and a number of jetties provide variety and stability to the sand bars.
                Look for the low tide lefts at Covo do Vapor and Rio plus the 7 jetties referred to as CDS.
                Further south the waves are usually smaller and easier for beginners to catch, as opposed to the fast bulky waves that break on the jetties.</p>

            <h2 class="surrounding-title">Surrounding? <br> <p class="surrounding-1-text">The Costa da Caparica is the stunning 26km coastline of glorious sandy beaches, powerful Atlantic waves and beautiful natural scenery, that extends along the western side of the Setubal Peninsula.
                The coastline is named after the largest town of the region, Costa da Caparica, which is a modern and lively resort town. Further down the coast is the traditional fishing village of Fonte da Telha, the pretty lagoon of Lagoa de Albufeira and vast expanses of pristine beaches.
                Much of the southern Costa da Caparica coastline lies within the “Arriba Fóssil”, and this nature preserve has protected the fossil rich-cliffs coastline from any major development.
                Although designated a city, and its public administration vested in the civil parish of Costa da Caparica,
                the area consists of several integrated communities and localities, including São João, Santo António, Terras da Costa and Fonte da Telha.
                With a population of 11,708 inhabitants, it represents 7.3% of the municipal population.</p>

                particularly during the summer (when there are an additional 7,800 residents and on average about 35,000 visitors).
                The Costa da Caparica coastline faces the might of the Atlantic Ocean, and onto the wide,
                sandy beaches powerful waves break, making it ideal for surfing and kitesurfing.
                From these beaches, fishermen employ traditional Xávega fishing techniques (by hauling the nets on to the beach) and with catches ladened with sardines.
                During the summer the Portuguese flock to the beautiful beaches of the region, and there is a buzz about the town of Costa da Caparica, while late at night beach parties are hosted at secluded beach bars.
                Most foreign tourists head to the beaches of the Cascais-Estoril coastline, but the Costa da Caparica is as equally enjoyable for a day on the beach.
                This guide will provide an introduction to Costa da Caparica region and the town of Costa da Caparica.</p>
